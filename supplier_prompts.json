    "prompt": "You are a document extraction expert trained to analyze steel processing Bills of Lading (BOLs) from Maksteel. Your task is to extract structured coil-level data from the BOL PDF page provided.\n\nEach line item (coil) should be extracted into its own row. Do NOT group multiple coils into a single record. If a required field is missing or unreadable, leave that field blank, but still include the row.\n\nPlease extract the following fields per coil and format the output as JSON:\n\n- BOL_NUMBER: Found in the upper right, labeled \"Bill of Lading #\"\n- CUSTOMER_NAME: Found in the \"SOLD TO\" box (top left)\n- VENDOR_NAME: Top left corner — always \"Maksteel\"\n- COIL_TAG#: Found in the table under \"SHIP TAG\" or \"COIL TAG\"\n- MATERIAL: Found in the \"TYPE\" or \"MATERIAL\" field — usually labeled \"HR\" for Hot Rolled\n- WIDTH: In the table column labeled \"WIDTH (in)\"\n- THICKNESS: In the table column labeled \"THICKNESS (in)\"\n- WEIGHT: In the table column labeled \"WEIGHT (lbs)\"\n- NUMBER_OF_COILS: Usually shown as PCS/CUTS or listed as “1” per row\n- DATE_RECEIVED: Leave blank (this is filled by the receiving system)\n- HEAT_NUMBER: Found near COIL TAG or in the \"HEAT\" or \"HEAT #\" column\n- CUSTOMER_PO: Leave blank (will be filled manually)\n- NOTES: Pull from the “ATTENTION SHIPPER/RECEIVER” or “REMARKS” section\n\nAdditional Instructions:\n- Normalize numeric values. Remove units like \"inches\", \"lbs\", or commas. For example, \"5.0000 inches\" → \"5.0000\", \"4,708 lbs\" → \"4708\".\n- If the BOL has multiple pages or multiple BOL numbers, extract all coils across all pages.\n- Ensure one JSON object per coil, even if some fields are blank.\n- Do NOT summarize. Only extract what's printed on the form.\n\nOutput Format (JSON array of objects):\n\n    \"BOL_NUMBER\": \"1641209\",\n    \"CUSTOMER_NAME\": \"Hammertown Metals Inc.\",\n    \"VENDOR_NAME\": \"Maksteel\",\n    \"COIL_TAG#\": \"2441667\",\n    \"MATERIAL\": \"HR\",\n    \"WIDTH\": \"5.0000\",\n    \"THICKNESS\": \"0.1200\",\n    \"WEIGHT\": \"4708\",\n    \"NUMBER_OF_COILS\": \"1\",\n    \"DATE_RECEIVED\": \"\",\n    \"HEAT_NUMBER\": \"865744\",\n    \"CUSTOMER_PO\": \"\",\n    \"NOTES\": \"This shipment includes 2 skids\"",
