I need you to generate a full, comprehensive system overview of the Nicayne OS platform as it currently exists. This overview will serve as the foundation for a formal progress report, so it must be clear, exhaustive, and technically accurate.

Please include the following in detail:

Platform Summary:

What Nicayne OS is designed to do

The primary workflows it supports (e.g., work orders, finished tags, BOLs, invoices)

Key user roles and interactions

System Architecture & Flow:

End-to-end flow: from intake to file generation to delivery

Modular file structure (e.g., pdf_outputs/, routing folders in Drive)

QR code embedding logic and how it integrates with downstream file access

How documents are routed to Drive folders or email based on customer and PO

Gmail Integration:

How Gmail OAuth was integrated (client ID, secret, token handling)

Secrets required and where theyâ€™re stored

How documents are now sent via email with PDF attachments

Fallback logic if email fails

Drive Integration:

Original Drive-based system (before email integration)

Folder structure and automated routing logic

File replacement behavior for QR-enabled versions

Access/sharing logic improvements and public link fallback

QR Code System:

QR embedding process for each document type

How the system replaces the non-QR version

What data the QR links to, and how it supports digital access

AI Integration:

Where AI is currently integrated (e.g., BOL data extraction, auto-routing, prompt-based generation)

Future or placeholder modules (e.g., upcoming invoice logic or OCR triggers)

Progress Milestones:

List all modules that are complete and working as of now

Describe any partially complete features or known limitations

Confirm which workflows are fully tested end-to-end

Secrets & Configuration Management:

Overview of environment variable keys used in .env or Replit secrets vault

Description of token refresh behavior and sensitive data flow

Next Steps (optional):

Any known planned features or expansion areas if previously mentioned

Please format the output for clarity using Markdown sections or headers, and organize it logically so it can be pasted directly into a formal report later.
