üì¶ CHUNK 2 ‚Äì Load and Filter Inventory Data by Customer

Now that the inventory dashboard routes and placeholder UI are in place, let's build the functionality that loads **customer-specific inventory data** from all three JSON inventory files.

---

üß† OBJECTIVE:
Allow the user to view filtered inventory data for a selected customer in each of these views:
- Unprocessed
- In-Process
- Processed
- Unified (all combined)

---

üî¢ BACKEND TASKS:

1. Load the following inventory JSON files:
   - `inventory_unprocessed.json`
   - `inventory_in_process.json`
   - `inventory_processed.json`

2. For each of the following routes:
   - `/inventory-report/unprocessed/<customer_name>`
   - `/inventory-report/in-process/<customer_name>`
   - `/inventory-report/processed/<customer_name>`
   - `/inventory-report/all/<customer_name>`

   Implement the following logic:
   - Load the relevant JSON file(s)
   - Filter entries where the `"customer"` field matches `<customer_name>` (case-insensitive)
   - Pass the filtered list to a Jinja template for rendering

3. Create a shared Jinja template:
   - `templates/inventory_report.html`
   - Display the report title (e.g. ‚ÄúUnprocessed Inventory for Hammertown‚Äù)
   - Render a clean HTML table with the following fields:
     - Date Received
     - Material Type
     - Dimensions (Thickness √ó Width √ó Length)
     - Pieces
     - Weight
     - Status (Unprocessed / In-Process / Processed)

---

üñº FRONTEND UPDATE:

In the existing `inventory_dashboard.html`:
- Make the customer input field dynamic ‚Äî it should submit a GET request to the selected route with the entered customer name.
- Update the four buttons to include the customer_name parameter in the URL.

For example, the button for ‚ÄúUnprocessed Inventory‚Äù should link to:
/inventory-report/unprocessed/{{ customer_name }}

‚úÖ SAFETY REMINDER:
Do not overwrite or alter the contents of the JSON inventory files. Only read and filter. Ensure all routes and templates degrade gracefully if a customer has **no matching records**.

Let me know once this is complete and working. We‚Äôll move on to **Chunk 3: Export to PDF and Email Reports.**
