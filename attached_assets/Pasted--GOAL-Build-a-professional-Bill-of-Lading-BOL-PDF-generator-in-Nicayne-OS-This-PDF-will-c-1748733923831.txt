✅ GOAL:
# Build a professional Bill of Lading (BOL) PDF generator in Nicayne OS.
# This PDF will consolidate all completed finished tags tied to a Work Order and create a single, printable BOL document.

# ✅ TRIGGER:
# Allow users to manually generate a Bill of Lading by selecting a Work Order number from a dropdown or archive.
# The BOL number will be auto-generated, using the format: BL###### (e.g., BL000123)

# ✅ PDF LAYOUT

- Auto-generate BOL number as a sequential or random 6-digit ID prefixed with BL
- Calculate total bundle count and total weight
- Return PDF as downloadable file
- Upload it to Google Drive in proper customer > PO folder
- Optionally store metadata (BOL number, work order, total weight, timestamp) in Google Sheet

# ✅ STYLE
- Clean, functional layout with clear headings
- Remove logo to conserve space
- Use Nicayne OS color scheme only if needed for light highlights (no unnecessary visuals)

# ✅ FUTURE EXTENSIONS (Optional, not needed now):
