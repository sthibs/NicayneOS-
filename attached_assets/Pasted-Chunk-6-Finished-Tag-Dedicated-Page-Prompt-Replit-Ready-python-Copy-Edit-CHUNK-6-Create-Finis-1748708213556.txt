# CHUNK 6: Create Finished Tag Entry Page for Nicayne Metal Processing

# ✅ GOALS:
# - Create a new route: `/finished-tag`
# - Display a printable form for operators to enter Finished Goods Tag data
# - Include: Date, Customer Name, Customer PO, Work Order, Material Grade, Material Description,
#   Number of Pieces, Finished Weight, Heat Number (auto-populated), Operator Initials, Incoming Tags
# - Buttons: [Duplicate Tag], [Print & Submit]
# - On submit: Save entry to Finished Goods Google Sheet AND push tag file into correct PO folder
# - File path structure:
#     My Drive > Chaos > Clients > Nicayne Metal Processing-Chaos > Customers > [Customer Name] > [Customer PO]
# - Auto-create Customer/PO folders if they don’t exist
# - Display live tag form in printable format (Dymo compatible)
# - Make `/finished-tag` its own clean standalone page, styled for tablet use

# ✅ ADDITIONAL LOGIC:
# - Auto-fill Customer Name + Work Order if Customer PO is provided (and vice versa)
# - Auto-populate Heat Number from incoming tags (already parsed in inventory)
# - Form must support duplicating an existing entry (with editable fields)
# - When tag is submitted:
#     1. Append to Finished Goods Sheet
#     2. Save JSON/PDF copy in correct PO folder (named: [Customer] - PO#[number])
#     3. Remove coil from “in-processed” tab in inventory and move to “processed” tab

# ✅ FILES TO CREATE:
# - `templates/finished_tag.html` (printable, clean layout)
# - New route in `app.py` or `routes/finished_tag.py` depending on structure

# ✅ FORM INPUTS:
# - Date (autofill today’s date)
# - Customer Name
# - Customer PO
# - Work Order Number
# - Material Grade
# - Material Description
# - Number of Pieces
# - Finished Weight
# - Heat Number (autofill from tag entry if matched)
# - Operator Initials
# - Incoming Tag Numbers (textarea or comma-separated)

# ✅ BUTTONS:
# - [Duplicate Tag]: Prefills current data into a new form instance
# - [Print & Submit]: Sends data to sheet + generates PDF tag

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT:
# - Do not affect existing BOL extractor or Work Order form
# - System must remain portable and continue using the current Google Sheet & Drive integrations

# Once completed, restart server and test `/finished-tag` route
