PROMPT TO SEND TO REPLIT
GOAL:
Unify the Quote system under a single tab and implement lifecycle logic that tracks the status of each quote (active, inactive, realized) with real-time linkage to the work order system.

üîß ACTION ITEMS:
1. Merge Quote Generator Into Quotes Tab
Eliminate the separate ‚ÄúQuote Generator‚Äù tab

Move the entire form and interface into the ‚ÄúQuotes‚Äù tab

The Quotes tab should now contain:

Quote submission form (slitting, cut-to-length, general info)

Quote extractor (on the same screen)

Add item functionality

Auto-calculated fields (PIW, OD, piece count, etc.)

2. Create a Quote Dashboard View (within Quotes tab)
Add a section above or beside the quote form called Quote Dashboard

Display a dynamic table showing the most recent 30 days of submitted quotes (fetched from the Google Sheet)

Each row should include:

Quote #

Date Submitted

Customer Name

Job Type (Slitting / CTL / Both)

PO (blank unless quote has been realized)

Status (Active, Inactive, or Realized)

[Optional] Link to uploaded quote or extracted data

3. Quote Lifecycle Logic
When a new quote is submitted, store it as Active and display it on the dashboard.

If no PO is received within 30 days, mark the quote as Inactive and remove it from the dashboard (but store it on the Google Sheet).

When a work order is generated and includes a reference to a Quote #, update that quote‚Äôs status to Realized.

4. Google Sheets Integration
Continue logging every quote to the Nicayne System Sheet ‚Äì Quotes Tab

Add a new column for:

Status (Active / Inactive / Realized)

Linked Work Order # (auto-filled when matched)

PO # (added when known)

Create a cleanup routine:

Any quote older than 30 days with no linked PO or work order is marked Inactive but still saved on the sheet

5. Visual Behavior in Dashboard
Show only Active and Realized quotes from the last 30 days in the dashboard

Clicking on a row can show expanded quote details (e.g. slitting specs, CTL specs, pricing model)

Include a toggle to ‚ÄúShow Inactive Quotes‚Äù if desired

6. Future-Proofing Hooks (optional for later)
Mark when a customer uploads a PO and link it back to a quote using quote ID

Later we can use that link to:

Trigger automatic work order generation

Archive the quote once the job is completed
