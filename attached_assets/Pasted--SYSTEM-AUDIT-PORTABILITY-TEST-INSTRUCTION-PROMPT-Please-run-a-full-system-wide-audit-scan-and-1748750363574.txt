 SYSTEM AUDIT & PORTABILITY TEST – INSTRUCTION PROMPT
Please run a full system-wide audit, scan, and debug on the Nicayne Metal Processing OS to ensure:

✅ FUNCTIONALITY CHECK
All forms (Work Order, Finished Tags, BOL, Invoice, Quotes, etc.) render correctly and submit data as intended.

Auto-generation features (work order numbers, tag numbers, BOL numbers, invoices, quote calculations) are working as expected.

Calculations (OD, PIW, finished piece estimates) are producing accurate results.

UI components (dropdowns, dynamic item additions, toggles) are functional and responsive.

Data extraction components (quote OCR extractor, BOL extractor) are returning the correct structured data.

📁 FILE & DATA ROUTING CHECK
Every generated PDF (work order, tag, BOL, invoice) is being routed to the correct Google Drive path:

My Drive > Chaos > Clients > Nicayne Metal Processing - Chaos > Customers > [Customer] > PO#[Number]

Uploaded files (Customer BOLs, original POs, quotes) are landing in the correct customer and PO folders.

All records are logged in the Nicayne System Sheet where applicable (Quotes, Work Orders, Tags, etc.).

File naming conventions are consistent (e.g., NMP-FINISHED-TAG-[DATE]-[WO#]-[PCS]pcs.pdf).

🔒 INTEGRITY AND ERROR HANDLING
Catch all common error conditions (e.g., missing PO, failed PDF upload, Google Sheets API errors).

Verify fallback logic is active (e.g., local JSON backup if Google API fails).

All required fields are validated on form submission.

Audit integrity dashboards (e.g., invoice tracker) return true and current results based on actual data.

📦 PORTABILITY TEST
Confirm all paths, secrets, and credentials are environment-variable driven.

No hardcoded references to specific file IDs, local paths, or restricted user tokens.

Modular structure allows system to be:

Packaged into a portable deployment bundle

Re-used or deployed for another customer or plant with only minimal input/config changes (e.g., folder IDs, branding, logo)

System should be exportable and redeployable with minimal setup via .env and credentials injection.

📊 REPORT REQUEST
After completing the above:

Return a detailed summary report showing:

✔ Passed Checks

Once this test is complete, I’d like to review the full output report before moving forward. Please ensure no functionality is skipped or assumed. Test the entire stack.
