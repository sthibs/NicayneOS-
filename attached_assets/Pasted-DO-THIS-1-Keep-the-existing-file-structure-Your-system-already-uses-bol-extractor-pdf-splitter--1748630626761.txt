DO THIS:
1. Keep the existing file structure:
Your system already uses:

bol_extractor/pdf_splitter.py (‚úÖ good)

bol_extractor/ocr_utils.py (‚úÖ already handles text extraction)

bol_extractor/llm_refiner.py (‚úÖ runs OpenAI/DeepSeek logic)

You don‚Äôt need to create new files like split_pdf_by_page or ocr_reader. Instead:

2. Update these files with better logic:
File	What to Add/Update
pdf_splitter.py	Make sure it splits and saves pages cleanly with unique filenames (you‚Äôre good here)
ocr_utils.py	Improve text cleanup if needed. Otherwise, leave it.
llm_refiner.py	Replace prompt logic with the new prompt you‚Äôve built (from Chunk 4). Also integrate the new parsing logic that skips empty coils.

3. No need to rename or create new module paths.
This is important: just drop your improved logic into existing files. That way:

You keep the working web uploader and Drive integration

You only enhance what needs enhancing: LLM prompt quality and JSON parsing

‚úçÔ∏è For example, in llm_refiner.py:
Replace your current OpenAI/DeepSeek call block with this logic (from Chunk 4):

python
Copy
Edit
# In llm_refiner.py

def run_extraction_with_fallback(text: str, prompt_prefix: str = ""):
    full_prompt = f"{prompt_prefix}\n\n{text}"
    
    try:
        return call_openai(full_prompt)
    except:
        return call_deepseek(full_prompt)

def parse_rows(raw_response):
    try:
        data = json.loads(raw_response)
        return [row for row in data if row.get("coil_tag")]  # Only rows with coil_tag
    except:
        return []
And update your process_pages() function to loop through all pages and combine the results like this:

python
Copy
Edit
all_rows = []

for page in pages:
    text = extract_text(page)
    response = run_extraction_with_fallback(text, supplier_prompt)
    rows = parse_rows(response)
    all_rows.extend(rows)
üí° Why This Is the Best Option
‚úÖ Keeps your working front end, uploader, and Google connections

‚úÖ Lets you keep scaling with Drive automation

‚úÖ Avoids folder/module confusion

‚úÖ Adds the more accurate logic you're building without breaking anything
