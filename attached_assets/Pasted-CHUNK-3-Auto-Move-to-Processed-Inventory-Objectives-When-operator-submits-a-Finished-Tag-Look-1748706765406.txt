CHUNK 3: Auto-Move to Processed Inventory
üéØ Objectives:
When operator submits a Finished Tag:

Look at incoming_tags field (usually coil tags)

Find matching rows in the in-processed Google Sheet

Copy those rows to a new tab: processed

Optionally delete or mark them in in-processed

Link each copied row with the Finished Tag ID for traceability

üß† Strategy:
Add this logic directly into your /finished-tag POST route (after Google Sheet write)

Maintain same headers across all sheets for easy migration

üì¶ Update Your POST Route in main.py
Right after appending to finished_goods, add this block:

python
Copy
Edit
# === MOVE TAGGED COILS TO PROCESSED ===
try:
    # Ensure processed tab exists
    try:
        processed = sheet.worksheet("processed")
    except gspread.exceptions.WorksheetNotFound:
        processed = sheet.add_worksheet(title="processed", rows="1000", cols="20")

    in_rows = in_proc.get_all_records()
    in_headers = in_proc.row_values(1)
    processed_headers = processed.row_values(1)

    if not processed_headers:
        processed.append_row(in_headers + ["Finished Tag #"])

    updated_rows = []
    tag_lookup = [t.strip().upper() for t in form.get("incoming_tags", "").split(",") if t.strip()]

    for idx, row in enumerate(in_rows, start=2):
        tag = str(row.get("Coil Tag", "")).upper()
        if tag in tag_lookup:
            values = [row.get(h, "") for h in in_headers]
            values.append(form["tag_id"])  # add finished tag reference
            processed.append_row(values)
            updated_rows.append(idx)

    # Remove or mark in-processed rows
    for row_idx in sorted(updated_rows, reverse=True):
        in_proc.delete_row(row_idx)

except Exception as e:
    print("Failed to move coils to processed tab:", e)
‚úÖ What This Does:
Checks incoming_tags submitted on the form

Finds all matching Coil Tags in in-processed

Copies each full row to processed + adds the Finished Tag #

Deletes them from in-processed (or mark logic can be used instead)

Optional (Future):
Add ‚ÄúStatus = Completed‚Äù column instead of deleting rows

Allow operator to review matched coils before submission

Include processed coil data in future reporting or invoice logic

You're now tracking every coil from:

Unprocessed ‚Üí In-processed ‚Üí Processed
