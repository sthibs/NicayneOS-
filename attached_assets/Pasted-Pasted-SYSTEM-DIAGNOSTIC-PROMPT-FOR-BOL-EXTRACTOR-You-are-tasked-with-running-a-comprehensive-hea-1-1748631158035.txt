# üì¶ SYSTEM DIAGNOSTIC PROMPT FOR BOL EXTRACTOR

You are tasked with running a **comprehensive health check** on the BOL Extractor system and PDF Splitter pipeline currently deployed using the CAIOS environment variables.

Please perform the following steps in order:

---

### üîç 1. CONFIGURATION VALIDATION
- Check that the following environment variables are present and properly loaded:
  - `OPEN_AI_API_KEY_CAIOS`
  - `DEEP_SEEK_API`
  - `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_CAIOS_NMP`
  - `SPREADSHEET_ID_NMP`
  - `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_CAIOS_ROOT`
  - `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_CLIENTS`
  - `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_NICAYNE`
  - `UNPROCESSED_INVENTORY_SHEET_URL_NMP`

If any are missing or improperly formatted, log the issue clearly.

---

### üìÑ 2. PDF SPLITTER TEST
- Use a sample multi-page test PDF (e.g., 5 pages)
- Run it through `bol_extractor/pdf_splitter.py`
- Confirm that:
  - It splits into 5 distinct pages
  - Each file is saved properly with unique names
  - Each page is accessible and contains readable OCR text

---

### üß† 3. LLM EXTRACTION TEST (OPENAI & DEEPSEEK)
- Send a known-good BOL page to the LLM pipeline via `bol_extractor/llm_refiner.py`
- Confirm:
  - It returns structured JSON with all expected keys:
    - `BOL_NUMBER`, `CUSTOMER_NAME`, `VENDOR_NAME`, `COIL_TAG#`, `MATERIAL`, `WIDTH`, `THICKNESS`, `WEIGHT`, `HEAT_NUMBER`, `NOTES`
  - It filters out blank rows or rows with no `COIL_TAG#`

Test both:
- OpenAI (primary)
- DeepSeek (fallback) ‚Äî by mocking OpenAI failure

---

### üì§ 4. GOOGLE SHEETS WRITE TEST
- Create a test row and attempt to write it to the `UNPROCESSED_INVENTORY_SHEET_URL_NMP` tab
- Confirm:
  - Credentials work
  - The row appears in the sheet
  - No 403/permission errors
  - The correct tab (gid=1968799585) is being used

---

### üóÇ 5. DIRECTORY & FILE STRUCTURE CHECK
- Confirm all the following modules exist and are used:
  - `bol_extractor/pdf_splitter.py`
  - `bol_extractor/llm_refiner.py`
  - `bol_extractor/ocr_utils.py`
  - `bol_extractor/config.py`
  - `bol_extractor/google_sheets.py`

Log any missing or unused modules.

---

### ‚úÖ FINAL REPORT
Output a structured summary including:
- ‚úî Which modules passed
- ‚ùå Which modules failed or need attention
- üõ† Suggested next steps to fix any issues found

This test should NOT overwrite any production files or modify your working sheet.
