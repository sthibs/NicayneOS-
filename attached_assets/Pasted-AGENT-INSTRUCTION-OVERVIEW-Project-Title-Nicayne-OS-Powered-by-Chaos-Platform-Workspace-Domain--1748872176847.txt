AGENT INSTRUCTION OVERVIEW
Project Title: Nicayne OS ‚Äì Powered by Chaos Platform

Workspace Domain: caios.app
System URL (planned): https://nicayne.caios.app

üìå What You‚Äôre Building:
You are developing a modular user access and communication system for a company called Nicayne, hosted inside the CAI.OS platform. Each employee will have a personalized email address (e.g., operator@caios.app, manager@caios.app) tied to their system login. Access levels will be set before account creation.

The platform will include:

A company email dashboard (inbox, compose, reply)

Role-based access to system tools (e.g., Finished Tag Form for operators)

Centralized user creation and permissions control

All hosted under caios.app using Gmail OAuth + Drive APIs already active

üîê Authentication:
You are using the existing Google Workspace and OAuth project under caios.app. Do not create a new workspace or project. All APIs (Gmail, Drive, Sheets) should authenticate through the current credentials.

üì¶ Final Goal:
A fully functioning Nicayne OS platform with:

Role-based login

Custom dashboards per role

Email interface

Linked permissions

All hosted under nicayne.caios.app
