Action Plan
Step 1: Enable Local Debug Mode to Bypass Google Sheets
In your extractor.py, add a debug-only mode toggle like this:

python
Copy
Edit
DEBUG_ONLY = True  # set to False when live

...

if DEBUG_ONLY:
    logger.info("üß™ DEBUG MODE ENABLED ‚Äì Extracted coils:")
    for i, coil in enumerate(validated_coils, 1):
        logger.info(f"{i}: {json.dumps(coil, indent=2)}")
else:
    sheets_writer.write_to_sheet(validated_coils)
This will print all the validated coils to your terminal without triggering the Google Sheets API at all.

Step 2: Log Every Rejected Coil
Inside your validation loop:

python
Copy
Edit
for coil in raw_coils:
    if not coil.get("coil_tag") or not coil.get("width") or not coil.get("thickness") or not coil.get("weight"):
        logger.warning(f"‚õîÔ∏è Rejected coil (missing required fields):\n{json.dumps(coil, indent=2)}")
        continue
    ...
This will show you exactly what‚Äôs being rejected and why.

Step 3: Relax the Validation for Debugging (Temporarily)
To confirm what's going wrong, temporarily reduce the strictness to include coils with just a coil_tag and width, and log those too:

python
Copy
Edit
# Soft validation for debug
if not coil.get("coil_tag") or not coil.get("width"):
    logger.warning(f"‚õîÔ∏è Skipping coil - missing coil_tag or width:\n{json.dumps(coil, indent=2)}")
    continue
This helps us identify partial extractions that we may want to salvage or improve via prompt refinement.

Step 4: Manually Review Output
Once the debug log shows all 12 coils, confirm:

Was one coil missing a decimal in width (e.g., "8" instead of "8.000")?

Was the tag non-numeric (e.g., dash, spacing issue)?

Did the prompt fail to capture the last row?

This will tell us if the issue is:

‚úÖ Validation too strict

‚úÖ AI failed to capture it

‚úÖ OCR mismatch

‚úÖ Table format inconsistency

‚úÖ Final Prompt Tweak (if needed)
Once you identify the issue, tweak the prompt to say something like:

‚ÄúOnly extract rows with numeric COIL_TAG values. The WIDTH should be interpreted as a decimal and appear in the table column immediately right of THICKNESS. Do not skip rows if WIDTH is a clean integer like ‚Äò8‚Äô ‚Äì convert it to 8.000.‚Äù
