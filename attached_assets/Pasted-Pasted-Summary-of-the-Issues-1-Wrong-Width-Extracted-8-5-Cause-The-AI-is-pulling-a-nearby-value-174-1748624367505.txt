Summary of the Issues
üü• 1. Wrong Width Extracted (8" ‚Üí 5")
Cause:
The AI is pulling a nearby value from the wrong table row, likely due to:

OCR overlap or merged rows

Lack of clear instruction on table column positions

üü• 2. Extra Rows with Only NUMBER_OF_COILS
Cause:
The LLM is returning partial coil data, probably when the line breaks or OCR layout confuse it.

üß† THE FIX STRATEGY
üîß A. Update the Prompt to Force Accurate Row Mapping
We will tell the LLM to only extract coil rows that contain ALL required fields, and to reference column positions:

‚úçÔ∏è NEW REFINED PROMPT (for Maksteel)
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "supplier": "maksteel",
  "prompt": "You are extracting coil data from a Bill of Lading from Maksteel. Each coil should be represented as a separate JSON object in an array. Only extract rows from the material table that contain ALL of the following fields: 'COIL_TAG#' (also called Ship Tag), 'HEAT#', 'THICKNESS', 'WIDTH', 'NUMBER_OF_COILS', and 'WEIGHT'. If any of these fields are missing, ignore the row. The WIDTH is always located between THICKNESS and NUMBER_OF_COILS ‚Äî ensure you extract the correct value from the proper column, not from other parts of the document. The WIDTH must be a valid decimal number like 8.000, not a whole number from elsewhere. Do not extract any rows without a valid numeric COIL_TAG#. Output format is a JSON array of coil objects. Each object must include:\n- customer: from the SOLD TO box\n- bol_number: top right\n- vendor: top left (Maksteel)\n- material_type: from the TYPE field (e.g., HR)\n- coil_tag\n- heat_number\n- thickness\n- width\n- number_of_coils\n- weight\n- notes: from ATTENTION TO SHIPPER/RECEIVER section\nLeave 'po_number' blank. Leave 'date_received' and 'validation_status' blank ‚Äî those will be auto-filled.\nEXAMPLE OUTPUT:\n[\n  {\n    \"customer\": \"Hammertown Metals Inc.\",\n    \"bol_number\": \"1641209\",\n    \"vendor\": \"Maksteel\",\n    \"material_type\": \"HR\",\n    \"coil_tag\": \"2441667\",\n    \"heat_number\": \"865744\",\n    \"thickness\": \"0.120\",\n    \"width\": \"8.000\",\n    \"number_of_coils\": \"1\",\n    \"weight\": \"4708\",\n    \"notes\": \"This shipment includes two skids.\",\n    \"po_number\": \"\",\n    \"validation_status\": \"\",\n    \"date_received\": \"\"\n  },\n  ...\n]"
}
üõ†Ô∏è B. Update Validation Logic to Match Prompt
In extractor.py, add this check:

python
Copy
Edit
# Coil must have all core fields and a numeric tag
if not coil.get("coil_tag") or not coil.get("width") or not coil.get("thickness") or not coil.get("weight"):
    logger.warning(f"Skipping incomplete coil entry: {coil}")
    continue

# Extra width validation
try:
    width = float(coil["width"])
    if width < 3.0 or width > 100.0:
        logger.warning(f"Suspicious width detected ({width}) ‚Äì skipping row")
        continue
except ValueError:
    logger.warning(f"Non-numeric width value ‚Äì skipping: {coil['width']}")
    continue
üß™ C. Optional Debug Log Enhancer
Add this to dump full AI result per upload for debugging:

python
Copy
Edit
logger.info("AI returned raw result:\n" + json.dumps(coil_data, indent=2))
‚úÖ What This Will Solve
Problem	Fixed by
Width misread (5" vs 8")	Prompt column mapping + validation logic
Extra rows	Tag requirement + stricter row validation
Partial JSON	Prompt enforces field completeness
Future-proofing	Logs show every value for debugging
