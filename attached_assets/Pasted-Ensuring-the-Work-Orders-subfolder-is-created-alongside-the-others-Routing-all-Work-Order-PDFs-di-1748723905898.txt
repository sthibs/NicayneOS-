🔧 PATCH: Ensure Work Orders folder is created and used for PDF uploads

📌 PROBLEM:
Work Order PDF submission is failing or not appearing in Drive, despite the rest of the customer/PO folder structure working fine.

📌 REASON:
The "Work Orders" subfolder is missing or not targeted during PDF upload. The upload logic either:
  - Fails due to a null folder ID
  - Uploads to the wrong root (e.g. service account Drive)

✅ FIX OBJECTIVES:
1. Add "Work Orders" to the list of subfolders during PO folder creation
2. Ensure the upload function targets the "Work Orders" folder correctly
3. Fail gracefully and log if the upload folder is not found

✅ PATCH STEPS:
*/

// STEP 1: Update PO Folder Creation Logic (usually in createPOFolders.ts or driveManager.js)
const subfolders = [
  'Work Orders',       // ✅ Make sure this is included!
  'Finished Tags',
  'Bills of Lading',
  'Invoices'
];

for (const name of subfolders) {
  await findOrCreateFolder(drive, name, poFolder.id);
}

// STEP 2: Update the Work Order PDF Upload Function
// Add this before the file upload logic:
const workOrdersFolderId = await getSubfolderId(poFolderId, 'Work Orders');

if (!workOrdersFolderId) {
  console.error('❌ Work Orders folder not found. Cannot upload PDF.');
  return;
}

// STEP 3: Ensure file is uploaded to correct folder
await drive.files.create({
  resource: {
    name: workOrderFileName,
    mimeType: 'application/pdf',
    parents: [workOrdersFolderId]  // ✅ Upload to correct subfolder
  },
  media: {
    mimeType: 'application/pdf',
    body: fs.createReadStream(localPDFPath)
  },
  fields: 'id'
});

/*
📦 END RESULT:
✅ All future work order PDFs will upload directly to:
Chaos > Clients > Nicayne Metal Processing - Chaos > Customers > [Customer] > PO#[Number] > Work Orders

🧪 ACTION:
Submit a new Work Order from the form and confirm the PDF appears inside the correct PO > Work Orders folder.
