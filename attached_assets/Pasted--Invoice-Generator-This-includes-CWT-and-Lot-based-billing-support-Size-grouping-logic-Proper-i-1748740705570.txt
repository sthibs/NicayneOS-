# ‚úÖ GOAL:
# Build an Invoice Generator tool that creates a properly formatted manufacturing invoice
# based on:
#   - the Work Order #
#   - Finished Tags
#   - Pricing method: CWT (per 100 lbs) or Lot Price (fixed total)

# ‚úÖ ROUTE:
# /generate-invoice

# ‚úÖ FORM UI:
# - Select Customer (dropdown)
# - Input Work Order # (autocomplete from existing)
# - Auto-fetch:
#   - Customer PO
#   - BOL #
#   - All Finished Tags tied to the Work Order

# - Choose Pricing Method:
#   [ ] CWT (per 100 lbs)
#     ‚Üí Input Rate (e.g., $12.50 per CWT)
#   [ ] Lot Price
#     ‚Üí Input Flat Amount (e.g., $1,500.00)

# - Auto-group tags by material size:
#   - For each size (e.g., 0.250 x 6 x 240):
#     ‚Üí Show total pieces and total weight

# - Optional Notes or Custom Charges (textarea)

# ‚úÖ PDF CONTENT:
# - Header: Nicayne Metal Processing Ltd.
# - Invoice Title and Date
# - Bill To: [Customer Name]
# - PO Number
# - Work Order #
# - BOL Number

# - Table:
#   | Material Description | Pieces | Weight (lbs) | Rate Type | Rate | Subtotal |
#   - One row per unique material size
#   - Rate Type: "CWT" or "Lot"
#   - If CWT: Subtotal = (weight / 100) * rate
#   - If Lot: Subtotal = flat rate (only 1 row allowed)

# - Bottom Section:
#   - Subtotal
#   - Tax (if applicable, disabled for now)
#   - Grand Total
#   - Optional Notes

#   - ‚ÄúThank you for your business‚Äù or custom message

# ‚úÖ LOGIC:
# - Use Work Order # to pull all tags from FINISHED_TAGS or JSON index
# - Auto-group by material size
# - Round weights to nearest lb
# - Only one pricing method allowed per invoice
# - If user selects CWT, calculate each row
# - If user selects Lot, show only one row with grand total

# ‚úÖ FILE HANDLING:
# - PDF file naming:
#   NMP-INVOICE-[DATE]-WO[#####]-PO[#####].pdf
# - Store in:
#   /Chaos/Clients/Nicayne Metal Processing - Chaos/Customers/[Customer]/PO#[PO#]/Invoice.pdf
# - Add to FINISHED_TAGS or INVOICE_LOG sheet if available

# ‚úÖ UI STYLE:
