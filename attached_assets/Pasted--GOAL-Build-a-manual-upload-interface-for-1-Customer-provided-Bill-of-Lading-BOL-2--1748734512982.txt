 ‚úÖ GOAL:
# Build a manual upload interface for:
# 1. Customer-provided Bill of Lading (BOL)
# 2. Customer‚Äôs original Purchase Order (PO)

# ‚úÖ DESTINATIONS:
# ‚Ä¢ Customer‚Äôs uploaded **BOLs** (manual + extracted) will go to:
#   ‚Üí /Chaos/Clients/Nicayne Metal Processing - Chaos/Customers/[Customer]/Uploaded BOLs/[BL######].pdf
#
# ‚Ä¢ Customer‚Äôs original **PO** will go to:
#   ‚Üí /Chaos/Clients/Nicayne Metal Processing - Chaos/Customers/[Customer]/PO#[PO####]/Customer PO.pdf

# ‚úÖ ROUTE:
# /manual-upload

# ‚úÖ UI REQUIREMENTS:
# - Customer selector (dropdown or autocomplete)
# - File type selector (BOL or Original PO)
# - PO# or BOL# input field (used to properly name and place file)
# - File upload input
# - Upload button
# - Confirmation message with Drive file preview link

# ‚úÖ FUNCTIONALITY:
# - When uploading a Customer BOL:
#   - Prompt for BOL#
#   - Save as: `BL######.pdf` in the Uploaded BOLs subfolder under the customer
#   - Create Uploaded BOLs folder if not already present

# - When uploading Original PO:
#   - Prompt for PO#
#   - Save as: `Customer PO.pdf` inside:
#     /[Customer]/PO#[PO####]/
#   - Create PO# folder if not already present

# ‚úÖ LOGIC:
# - All uploaded BOLs (manual + auto-extracted) should live together in the **Uploaded BOLs** folder under each customer
# - Uploaded BOLs should always be saved by their BOL number (e.g., `BL023456.pdf`)
# - System should confirm if file already exists before overwriting

# ‚úÖ VISUAL STYLE:
# - Match Nicayne OS theme: dark navy base (#00203F), neutral background (#F2F2F2), accent blue (#005baa)
# - Section headers: ‚ÄúUpload Customer BOL‚Äù / ‚ÄúUpload Original PO‚Äù
# - Large upload zones with drag & drop support (if feasible)

# ‚úÖ FUTURE OPTIONS:
# - Add OCR scan on uploaded BOL to extract basic info
# - Allow uploading multiple BOLs at once
# - Add signed copy upload under same BOL#

This will give your team and customers a clean UI for manually uploading both:

üìÑ Original Purchase Orders

üì¶ Customer Bills of Lading (manual uploads or automated, all in one place)
