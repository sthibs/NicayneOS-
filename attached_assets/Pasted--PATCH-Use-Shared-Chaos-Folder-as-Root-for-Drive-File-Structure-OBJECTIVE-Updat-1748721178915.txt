# üîß PATCH: Use Shared ‚ÄúChaos‚Äù Folder as Root for Drive File Structure

"""
üõ†Ô∏è OBJECTIVE:
Update the folder creation logic so that all customer + PO folders are created **under the shared "Chaos" folder** in your main Google Drive, not inside the private service account drive.

üìå ACTIONS:
1. Replace any `null` or missing `parentId` logic with a fixed parent ID tied to your shared "Chaos" folder
2. This ensures all folders land inside:
   My Drive > Chaos > Clients > Nicayne Metal Processing - Chaos > Customers > [Customer] > PO#[Number]

üîê SHARED FOLDER SETUP:
You‚Äôve already shared the "Chaos" folder with the service account (e.g., caios-agent@...)
Now we use that folder's ID directly in the code.

‚úÖ PATCH INSTRUCTIONS:

Open: `utils/createPoFolders.ts` (or your folder creation module)

‚û°Ô∏è Find the current root folder logic (likely using `null` or searching for "Chaos")

üîÅ Replace the root folder creation with the following:

"""

# Replace this string with the actual ID of your shared "Chaos" folder
CHAOS_FOLDER_ID = "PASTE_YOUR_CHAOS_FOLDER_ID_HERE"

# Updated root-level logic
async def findOrCreateFolder(drive, name, parentId):
    query = f"name = '{name}' and mimeType = 'application/vnd.google-apps.folder'"
    if parentId:
        query += f" and '{parentId}' in parents"

    res = await drive.files().list(q=query, fields="files(id, name)").execute()
    if res['files']:
        return res['files'][0]

    metadata = {
        'name': name,
        'mimeType': 'application/vnd.google-apps.folder',
        'parents': [parentId or CHAOS_FOLDER_ID]  # <-- Use CHAOS folder as default
    }

    file = await drive.files().create(body=metadata, fields="id").execute()
    return {'id': file['id'], 'name': name}

"""
üí° Use this updated function consistently when creating:
- Clients
- Company
- Customers
- PO folders
- Subfolders

‚úÖ RESULT:
All folders and files will now land inside your shared Drive hierarchy under Chaos > Clients > ...

üß™ NEXT: Submit a Work Order and confirm folder + PDF appear in your Drive, not in service account Drive.
