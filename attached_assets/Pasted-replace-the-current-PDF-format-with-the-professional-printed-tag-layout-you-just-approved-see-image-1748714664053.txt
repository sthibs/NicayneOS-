# CHUNK: FINISHED TAG PDF REDESIGN FOR PRINTABLE OUTPUT

"""
üìå OBJECTIVE:
Replace the current basic PDF format for the finished tag with a professionally formatted layout that matches the approved visual mockup.

üìÅ Target layout:
- Based on uploaded image: "A_label_design_document_for_Nicayne_Metal_Processing.png"
- Clean table/grid structure with NMP logo
- Proper spacing for clipboard printing or adhesive label (Dymo-compatible)

‚úÖ HEADER (top bar):
- Nicayne Metal Processing logo (or text header if image unavailable)
- Tag ID: right-aligned, bold
- Date: top-left

‚úÖ SECTION 1: Job Info
- Work Order #: bold
- Customer Name
- Customer PO

‚úÖ SECTION 2: Material Info
- Material Grade (bold)
- Material Description (e.g. 0.250 x 6.00 x 240 or COIL)
- # of Pieces / Coils
- Finished Weight
- Heat Number(s) ‚Äî allow multiple lines if needed
- Incoming Tag(s)

‚úÖ SECTION 3: Operator Block
- Operator Initials box (bottom-right)

‚úÖ PDF SETTINGS:
- Fixed width layout: 4x6 inches (Dymo label size)
- Font: Clear, sans-serif (Helvetica or Arial)
- Add solid border lines between sections
- Use consistent margins and alignment
- No color (black & white label output)
- Use bold labels (e.g., "Customer:", "PO:", "Material Grade:")

‚úÖ OUTPUT NAMING:
- Format: NMP-FINISHED-TAG-[DATE]-[WORK ORDER]-[PIECES]pcs.pdf
- Save to /pdf_outputs/
- Upload to correct Drive folder as done previously

‚úÖ SAFETY:
- Must still support full offline fallback (save to local file even if upload fails)
- Preserve the same data passed in form (from finished tag submission)

‚úÖ DEPLOY:
- Replace existing `generate_finished_tag_pdf()` function with new layout
- Use `reportlab` or alternate PDF generation library if preferred
- Restart server and test by submitting a new tag
