âœ… REPLIT PATCH PROMPT
This version uses all three secrets, and avoids searching or recreating folders. Just copy-paste:

python
Copy
Edit
# ðŸ”§ PATCH: Use Fixed Folder IDs from Secrets (CAIOS, CLIENTS, NMP)

"""
âœ… OBJECTIVE:
Ensure folder creation (Customers, POs, etc.) happens strictly inside the existing Drive folder hierarchy, using these secrets:

- `CAIOS_ROOT_FOLDER_URL` â†’ top-level 'Chaos' folder
- `CLIENTS_FOLDER_URL` â†’ 'Chaos/Clients'
- `NMP_FOLDER_URL` â†’ 'Chaos/Clients/Nicayne Metal Processing - Chaos'

ðŸ“Œ INSTRUCTIONS:

1. In your folder creation file (e.g., `drive_utils.py` or `create_po_folders.py`), replace any logic that searches for folders like "Chaos", "Clients", or "Nicayne Metal Processing" with hardcoded IDs pulled from the secrets.

2. Extract just the folder IDs from the URL (in case full URLs were saved):

```python
import os

def get_folder_id(secret_name):
    val = os.environ.get(secret_name)
    if val is None:
        raise Exception(f"Missing secret: {secret_name}")
    return val.split('folders/')[-1].split('?')[0] if 'folders/' in val else val

CHAOS_ROOT_ID = get_folder_id("CAIOS_ROOT_FOLDER_URL")
CLIENTS_FOLDER_ID = get_folder_id("CLIENTS_FOLDER_URL")
NMP_FOLDER_ID = get_folder_id("NMP_FOLDER_URL")
Replace all folder creation calls like this:

python
Copy
Edit
# Example: creating a customer folder under NMP
metadata = {
    'name': customer_name,
    'mimeType': 'application/vnd.google-apps.folder',
    'parents': [NMP_FOLDER_ID]
}
âœ… Remove or comment out all drive.files().list(...) logic that tries to search by name for:

Chaos

Clients

Nicayne Metal Processing

âœ… RESULT:

All folders (Customers, POs, Finished Tags, Work Orders, etc.) will now be created in the exact intended structure

No more duplication in service account space

Everything will show up in your personal Drive, as designed
