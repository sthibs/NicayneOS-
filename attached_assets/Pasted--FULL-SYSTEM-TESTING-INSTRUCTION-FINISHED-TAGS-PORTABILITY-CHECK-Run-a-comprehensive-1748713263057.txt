# üîß FULL SYSTEM TESTING INSTRUCTION ‚Äì FINISHED TAGS + PORTABILITY CHECK

"""
Run a comprehensive diagnostic and validation of the entire Nicayne Metal Processing system, with a special focus on the Finished Tags module.

üìå PHASE 1: ROUTE & MODULE TESTING

1. ROUTE INTEGRITY
   - Test all routes:
     - /finished-tag ‚Üí form loads, fields populate
     - /finished-tags ‚Üí archive loads, filters function
     - Navigation links work between views

2. FORM FUNCTIONALITY
   - Submit a sample finished tag using a known work order and tag number
   - Auto-fill: customer name, PO, material, and heat number pulled from prior data
   - Validate all inputs: weight, pieces, date, operator initials, tag ID

3. PDF GENERATION
   - Confirm PDF is generated with correct naming:
     NMP-FINISHED-TAG-[DATE]-[WORK ORDER]-[PIECES]pcs.pdf
   - Download works on submit
   - Regeneration via archive also works

4. GOOGLE DRIVE INTEGRATION
   - Validate folder creation at:
     Chaos/Clients/Nicayne Metal Processing - Chaos/Customers/[Customer]/[Customer] - PO#[Number]
   - Confirm PDF appears in correct folder
   - Track upload success in logs

5. GOOGLE SHEETS INTEGRATION
   - FINISHED_TAGS tab should record:
     - All submitted tag data
     - Timestamps
     - Upload + PDF status
   - Inventory movement:
     - Tags listed in incoming ‚Üí move coil from IN_PROCESS to PROCESSED inventory

6. ARCHIVE VIEWER (/finished-tags)
   - Search: by tag, PO, work order, customer
   - Use ‚ÄúDuplicate‚Äù and confirm pre-fill works
   - Export CSV and verify contents
   - View details, heat numbers, and download PDF from list
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness

7. ERROR HANDLING
   - Submit invalid tag ‚Üí confirm system doesn‚Äôt crash and gives feedback
   - Simulate Google Drive/Sheets disconnection ‚Üí confirm local logging still occurs

8. BACKUP LOGIC
   - Verify local JSON save for every tag submission
   - Audit trail preserved even if cloud fails

üìå PHASE 2: PORTABILITY TESTING

1. FULL SYSTEM PORTABILITY
   - Test if entire system can be ported to:
     - Another Google Workspace account
     - Another deployment folder (with updated sheet/Drive secrets)
     - A clean environment with same structure and secrets
   - Confirm that no hard-coded paths or fixed IDs block portability

2. FINISHED TAG MODULE PORTABILITY
   - Test Finished Tag form, PDF gen, Drive upload, and Sheets tracking:
     - In a different company folder
     - With alternate clients/POs
     - With updated Drive structure

   ‚úÖ Pass criteria:
     - Module works in a new context with new folders
     - All integrations remap correctly when secrets and folders are reassigned

üìå FINAL DELIVERABLE

- ‚úÖ All tests pass without critical errors
- ‚úÖ All uploads and tracking succeed
- ‚úÖ All routes accessible
- ‚úÖ Inventory flows traceable
- ‚úÖ Finished Tags module confirmed portable and production-ready
- ‚úÖ Logs and backups created
