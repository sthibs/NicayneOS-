Finalize and Correct Quote Generator General Info + Slitting Quote Section
Objective:
Revise the Quote Generator form by rebuilding the General Job Information section (based on original sketch) and finalizing the Slitting Jobs quote structure with all required logic and fields.

✅ PART 1: General Job Information – Quote Form
🔁 Reference: Original work order sketch IMG_E8E0B5C3-A399-4367-BD60-114C86FEE855.jpeg

Rebuild the top section of the Quote Generator form with the following fields:

Field Label	Type	Notes
Quote Number	Auto-generated	Format: Q-yyyyMMdd-hhmmss
Customer Name	Text	Required
Date Required	Date picker	Required
Date Created	Auto-filled	Current date
Packaging Instructions / Customer Request	Textarea (full width)	Optional
Max Bundle/Skid Weight	Text	e.g. “5000 lbs”
Requested Pieces Per Skid	Text	e.g. “10”
Max OD	Text	e.g. “72 inches”
Wood Spacers	Checkbox (Y/N)	
Paper Wrapped	Checkbox (Y/N)	
Edge Protectors	Checkbox (Y/N)	
Coil Direction on Skid	Radio (CW/CCW)	
Split Coil?	Checkbox	Optional

🚫 Do NOT include: Work Order # or Customer PO – these will not exist at this stage.

✅ PART 2: Tolerance Logic
Allow the user to dynamically add multiple tolerance sets with an “+ Add Tolerance Set” button.

Each set includes:

Thickness Tolerance (e.g. ±.005)

Width Tolerance (e.g. ±.010)

Length Tolerance (e.g. ±.250 / –.000)

✅ PART 3: Slitting Jobs – Quote Form Section
Each Slitting Job quote entry should follow the same layout and functionality as the work order form (minus customer tags), with one extra field:

Field Label	Notes
Material Grade	
Coil Description	
Incoming Weight (lbs)	
Incoming Coils	
OD Size (in)	Auto-generated from thickness, width, weight, ID (use 20" default)
PIW (lbs/in)	Auto-generated using formula: weight ÷ (thickness × width)
Slitter Setup	
Number of Skids	New field – Required

Users must be able to click “+ Add Slitting Job” to dynamically add multiple slitting entries.

🧮 Auto Calculations (Slitting Jobs):
OD Size: Based on coil ID (in), weight, and dimensions. Use placeholder logic if full equation not yet implemented.

PIW: weight ÷ (thickness × width) – Use .2836 density for steel in future steps if needed.

🗂️ Logging Requirement
Log all quote entries into the Quotes tab of the Nicayne System Sheet alongside Quote Number, Date, Customer Name, and Summary Totals.

This spreadsheet lives in the same Google Sheet where other system logs (e.g., Work Orders, Finished Tags) are stored.
