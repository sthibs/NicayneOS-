📦 APPLY TO:
Apply this style system-wide across every interface file you've already created and reuse the same CSS (e.g. /static/style.css). Make it the default global theme for the Nicayne OS.

DO NOT change route logic, back-end behavior, or JavaScript event handling unless required for layout.

✅ Return the updated base layout file (HTML or Jinja template) with embedded CSS or import link so it applies globally across all pages.
